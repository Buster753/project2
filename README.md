# The Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Game

The Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game is an improved version of the old Rock Paper Scissors game created by the popular sitcom-show The Big Bang Theory. In the show one of the main characters called Sheldon expresses his opinon that Rock paper scissors is too simplistic and therefore adds two additions to the game, Lizard and Spock.

The Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Game website is a website that strives to let more people try out and have fun with this new version of Rock Paper scissors.

# Struggles and Bugs
The Bugs and struggles of creating this game mainly came from eventListeners. 
Because of a minor syntax error the buttons would automatically clickthemself at page load.
This was later resolved after looking thorugh some stackoverflow pages and docs at W3C Schools.

# Deployment
Deployment of this website was done through github. 
To do this I entered the settings of this respository
